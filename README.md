# WEB-CHAT-CALL-bla.gg

**bla.gg** is an open-source audio/video chat platform that aims to be a lightweight alternative to Skype. It’s built with a minimalist tech stack – **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HyperScript** (for UX), **WebRTC** (for peer-to-peer calls), and **GUN.js** (for decentralized identity & messaging). The entire app runs as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, meaning it can be installed on devices and even works offline. All communication is peer-to-peer (P2P) by default, with optional self-hosted servers for improved connectivity and bridging to traditional networks. Security is a first-class concern, with end-to-end encryption for messages and secure protocols for calls.
